This solar imaging rig is a fairly inexpensive one (as far as astronomy goes). It utilizes most of the same gear that I already owned. No dedicated solar camera, just reusing my monochromatic guide camera and no dedicated mount using the mount that came with my Celestron 5SE. The only special gear this rig contains is, of course, the Lunt dedicated solar telescope. In my case, I am using the 50mm version. However this setup would work just as well with the less expensive 40mm Lunt or other equivalently sized solar scopes as the total weight of scopes this size are quite light and well under the 5SE mount's weight limit.
