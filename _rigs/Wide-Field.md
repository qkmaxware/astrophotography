The portable rig is designed for maximum portability while still retaining enough power for wide-field deep sky photography. The SkyWatcher Alt-Az GTi is lightweight and able to be powered via a powerbox, portable battery, or even AA batteries if all else fails. I am currently powering the telescope using the Celestron Lithium PowerTank Lithium which is also light and provided about 10 hours of running time for the mount. The William Optics Gran Turismo 71 is a little on the heavy side. Usually with this mount, amature astronomy tend to buy 60mm scopes rather than 71mm ones. However, the GT 71mm scope is a triplet compared to the 60mm scopes tending to be doublets so you get slightly better optics and with the added 10mm of aperture you can capture slightly fainter objects. 

For imaging, the William Optics 6AIII reducer/flattener is used mainly for it's field flattening capabilities rather than the focal reduction it provides. This creates a flat image across the width of most astronomy cameras. Speaking of, the camera used currently in this config is the ZWO ASI-662MC colour camera. Other cameras would also work here, but I already owned this camera for imaging planets, maybe I will change this at some point in the future as the camera is not optimized for deep sky imaging. For this rig, a PRO version of any camera cannot be used because the added cooler would add both more weight, which is already at the limit of the mount's capabilities, and requires another power source since the Celestron PowerTank can only power one thing at a time.
